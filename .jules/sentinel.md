## 2024-05-24 - Unsanitized input used in dangerouslySetInnerHTML
**Vulnerability:** Several components render raw HTML user input without sanitization using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Specifically, `article.content`, `item.content`, `proposal.content` and `item.embedCode` are rendered as is, opening up Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
**Learning:** In Next.js applications, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is commonly used to render rich text. However, when the content is from an untrusted source or user input, it poses a significant XSS risk if not sanitized properly on the client and server.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize HTML input using a library like `dompurify` (or `isomorphic-dompurify` for SSR/Server Components) before passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Ensure that both client-side sanitization and server-side validation/sanitization are implemented as defense-in-depth measures. Whitelist necessary tags like `iframe` for video embeds securely.
## 2024-03-18 - [Fix Missing HTML Sanitization]
**Vulnerability:** Found `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` being used without `clientSanitize` in `src/components/Banner.tsx` and `src/components/NewsCard.tsx`.
**Learning:** Even internal content from a CMS should be sanitized before rendering on the client to prevent XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `clientSanitize` (from `@/lib/client-sanitize`) when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in client components.
## 2024-03-20 - Unrestricted SSRF via AI URL Fetcher
**Vulnerability:** The Genkit flow `generateNewsContent` allows fetching the contents of any arbitrary URL without checking if it resolves to a private or local IP address, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This could allow internal network mapping or reading sensitive metadata.
**Learning:** Tools used by AI flows, especially those accepting raw URLs to fetch content, must have strict network boundary protections to prevent SSRF just like any traditional proxy or webhook endpoint.
**Prevention:** Implement strict IP boundary checks and protocol validation using the `URL` API. Use boundary-matched regular expressions (e.g., `/^10\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`) instead of prefix matching to accurately identify private ranges without accidentally blocking legitimate subdomains.
## 2026-06-27 - Next.js Server Actions missing authentication
**Vulnerability:** Next.js Server Actions in `src/actions/admin.ts` and `src/actions/gallery.ts` were publicly accessible without authentication, allowing any user to write JSON files and upload files to the server.
**Learning:** Next.js Server Actions are publicly exposed API endpoints by default. They do not automatically inherit client-side authentication state or route-level middleware protection.
**Prevention:** Always implement explicit server-side authorization checks (e.g., `await verifyAdmin()`) at the very beginning of any Server Action that performs sensitive operations or mutations. Share Firebase client auth state with Server Actions by storing the ID token in a cookie via `onIdTokenChanged`.
