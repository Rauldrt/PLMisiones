## 2024-05-24 - Unsanitized input used in dangerouslySetInnerHTML
**Vulnerability:** Several components render raw HTML user input without sanitization using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Specifically, `article.content`, `item.content`, `proposal.content` and `item.embedCode` are rendered as is, opening up Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
**Learning:** In Next.js applications, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is commonly used to render rich text. However, when the content is from an untrusted source or user input, it poses a significant XSS risk if not sanitized properly on the client and server.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize HTML input using a library like `dompurify` (or `isomorphic-dompurify` for SSR/Server Components) before passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Ensure that both client-side sanitization and server-side validation/sanitization are implemented as defense-in-depth measures. Whitelist necessary tags like `iframe` for video embeds securely.

**Vulnerability:** Found `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` being used without `clientSanitize` in `src/components/Banner.tsx` and `src/components/NewsCard.tsx`.
**Learning:** Even internal content from a CMS should be sanitized before rendering on the client to prevent XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `clientSanitize` (from `@/lib/client-sanitize`) when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in client components.
## 2024-03-20 - Unrestricted SSRF via AI URL Fetcher
**Vulnerability:** The Genkit flow `generateNewsContent` allows fetching the contents of any arbitrary URL without checking if it resolves to a private or local IP address, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This could allow internal network mapping or reading sensitive metadata.
**Learning:** Tools used by AI flows, especially those accepting raw URLs to fetch content, must have strict network boundary protections to prevent SSRF just like any traditional proxy or webhook endpoint.
**Prevention:** Implement strict IP boundary checks and protocol validation using the `URL` API. Use boundary-matched regular expressions (e.g., `/^10\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`) instead of prefix matching to accurately identify private ranges without accidentally blocking legitimate subdomains.

## 26-05-14 - Prevent DNS Rebinding SSRF
**Vulnerability:** A TOCTOU SSRF existed in `generate-news-from-url.ts` where `dns.lookup` validated an IP against private network ranges, but a subsequent `fetch` used the original hostname, allowing an attacker to change the DNS record to a private IP in between the check and the fetch.
**Learning:** Native `fetch` inherently performs its own DNS resolution, negating pre-flight `dns.lookup` validation. Replacing the URL's hostname with the validated IP breaks HTTPS/SNI for most modern sites.
**Prevention:** Use `http.request` and `https.request` instead of `fetch`, and pass the pre-validated IP address via a custom `lookup` function in the request options to guarantee the connection uses the exact checked IP while preserving the original hostname for SNI.
