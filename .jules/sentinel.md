## 2024-05-24 - Unsanitized input used in dangerouslySetInnerHTML
**Vulnerability:** Several components render raw HTML user input without sanitization using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Specifically, `article.content`, `item.content`, `proposal.content` and `item.embedCode` are rendered as is, opening up Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
**Learning:** In Next.js applications, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is commonly used to render rich text. However, when the content is from an untrusted source or user input, it poses a significant XSS risk if not sanitized properly on the client and server.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize HTML input using a library like `dompurify` (or `isomorphic-dompurify` for SSR/Server Components) before passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Ensure that both client-side sanitization and server-side validation/sanitization are implemented as defense-in-depth measures. Whitelist necessary tags like `iframe` for video embeds securely.

**Vulnerability:** Found `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` being used without `clientSanitize` in `src/components/Banner.tsx` and `src/components/NewsCard.tsx`.
**Learning:** Even internal content from a CMS should be sanitized before rendering on the client to prevent XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `clientSanitize` (from `@/lib/client-sanitize`) when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in client components.
## 2024-03-20 - Unrestricted SSRF via AI URL Fetcher
**Vulnerability:** The Genkit flow `generateNewsContent` allows fetching the contents of any arbitrary URL without checking if it resolves to a private or local IP address, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This could allow internal network mapping or reading sensitive metadata.
**Learning:** Tools used by AI flows, especially those accepting raw URLs to fetch content, must have strict network boundary protections to prevent SSRF just like any traditional proxy or webhook endpoint.
**Prevention:** Implement strict IP boundary checks and protocol validation using the `URL` API. Use boundary-matched regular expressions (e.g., `/^10\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`) instead of prefix matching to accurately identify private ranges without accidentally blocking legitimate subdomains.

## 2024-05-24 - Stored XSS via Unrestricted SVG Uploads
**Vulnerability:** The application allowed uploading of SVG files (`.svg`) in the public file upload functionality (`uploadPublicFilesAction`). SVG files can contain embedded `<script>` tags, which execute JavaScript in the user's browser context when the image is viewed directly, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Learning:** While SVGs are often treated purely as image assets, they are essentially XML documents capable of executing code. Allowing untrusted users to upload SVGs poses a significant security risk, especially if served from the same origin as the application.
**Prevention:** Remove `.svg` from the allowed extensions whitelist for file uploads. If SVG support is strictly necessary, ensure uploaded SVGs are properly sanitized using a robust library on the server-side to strip potentially malicious embedded scripts, or serve user-uploaded content from a distinct, isolated domain to mitigate impact.
