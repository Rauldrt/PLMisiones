## 2024-05-24 - Unsanitized input used in dangerouslySetInnerHTML
**Vulnerability:** Several components render raw HTML user input without sanitization using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Specifically, `article.content`, `item.content`, `proposal.content` and `item.embedCode` are rendered as is, opening up Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
**Learning:** In Next.js applications, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is commonly used to render rich text. However, when the content is from an untrusted source or user input, it poses a significant XSS risk if not sanitized properly on the client and server.
**Prevention:** Always sanitize HTML input using a library like `dompurify` (or `isomorphic-dompurify` for SSR/Server Components) before passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Ensure that both client-side sanitization and server-side validation/sanitization are implemented as defense-in-depth measures. Whitelist necessary tags like `iframe` for video embeds securely.
## 2024-03-18 - [Fix Missing HTML Sanitization]
**Vulnerability:** Found `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` being used without `clientSanitize` in `src/components/Banner.tsx` and `src/components/NewsCard.tsx`.
**Learning:** Even internal content from a CMS should be sanitized before rendering on the client to prevent XSS.
**Prevention:** Always use `clientSanitize` (from `@/lib/client-sanitize`) when using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in client components.
## 2024-03-20 - Unrestricted SSRF via AI URL Fetcher
**Vulnerability:** The Genkit flow `generateNewsContent` allows fetching the contents of any arbitrary URL without checking if it resolves to a private or local IP address, leading to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This could allow internal network mapping or reading sensitive metadata.
**Learning:** Tools used by AI flows, especially those accepting raw URLs to fetch content, must have strict network boundary protections to prevent SSRF just like any traditional proxy or webhook endpoint.
**Prevention:** Implement strict IP boundary checks and protocol validation using the `URL` API. Use boundary-matched regular expressions (e.g., `/^10\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+$/`) instead of prefix matching to accurately identify private ranges without accidentally blocking legitimate subdomains.
## 2024-06-10 - Unauthenticated Server Actions for Data Mutation
**Vulnerability:** Next.js Server Actions used to update sensitive data (e.g., `src/actions/admin.ts`, `src/actions/gallery.ts`) were entirely public, bypassing client-side Firebase authentication.
**Learning:** Next.js Server Actions are public API endpoints by default. Firebase client authentication state does not automatically propagate to or protect Server Actions.
**Prevention:** Server Actions must explicitly implement server-side authorization checks. For Firebase, this requires syncing the ID token to a session cookie (using `onIdTokenChanged`) and manually verifying the token server-side (e.g., via Google Identity Toolkit API) before allowing state mutations.
